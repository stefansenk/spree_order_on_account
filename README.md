Spree Order On Account
======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefansenk/spree_order_on_account.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefansenk/spree_order_on_account)

Adds an option the the spree user to allow order on account. Provides an OrderOnAccount payment method which allows enabled accounts to complete the checkout without a payment.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:
  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_order_on_account', github: 'stefansenk/spree_order_on_account', branch: 'X-X-stable'
  ```

  The `branch` option is important: it must match the version of Spree you're using.
  For example, use `3-1-stable` if you're using Spree `3-1-stable` or any `3.1.x` version.

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_order_on_account:install
  ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_order_on_account/factories'
```
